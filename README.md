Unzip and test on a local server like XAMPP, WAMPP or AMPP.
Copy the SQL code from the sql file and input it into your phpmyadmin.
Make sure database and table names matches across all files that require it or there WILL be errors.
NB: Should be in the htdocs folder if using XAMPP or the www folder if you're using AMPP.

I'm open to contributions. I didn't work much on the front end though. Sorry about that.
